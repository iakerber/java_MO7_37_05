I have come upon a couple of stumbling blocks that have stopped me in my tracks and I cannot continue at this time while I have so much else I need to complete for this course before this final week of the course has ended. I hope to come back to this, but I don't see myself having that kind of time before the end of the course.

I discovered that the Mac version of XAMPP does not include Tomcat, after much back and forth research. At least that is the conclusion I came to. (My XAMPP version includes Apache, MySQL and ProFTPD). I could download a separate version of Tomcat, which I looked for and got completely confused because I couldn't tell which page was a legitimate page, which download is a safe one, and even where the download is located. There were so many versions, and very verbose pages and I was terrified of downloading something that has some type of malware, as there was plenty of warning everywhere about checking SHA hashes, -- I didn't think I could deal with a corrupted computer at this point, so I bowed out of Tomcat, and thus out of a server that could handle a WAR file.

Also, I am more and more dissatisfied with how my Visual Studio Code is not handling these Java extras and making it difficult and impossible to package up the servlets into WAR files, as opposed to Eclipse, IntelliJ having a special WAR Export function -- I think perhaps at the very beginning of the course there should be a requirement to use Eclipse or IntelliJ in order for our completion of the exercises be less painful. I tried to figure out how to create the WAR files manually, by creating root directory MyWebApp, creating WEB-INF directory, creating classes directory and lib directory, web.xml, but abandoned the idea at the stage where I am at.

I did find the .jar file for javax.servlet, which serves the older types of files (before Jakarta), and was hoping that would help push me forward, as I succeeded in getting the files to point to the right file in the reference library.

All this explanation is just to say that I am willing to take the consequences and have salvaged my answers to the assignments as best I could under the circumstances. I wish we had more time, especially with these final various downloads and new topics, to experiment and to fail and to succeed - we need another 8-week course as part II. Thanks -- Ilze Akerbergs
